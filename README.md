# Chatty

Chatty is a web based application that allows users to chat with others by adding them on the application.

## The Problem

People needed a platform for chatting with their loved ones and friends in a very safe, light, and speedy way.

## The Solution

Chatty is a web based chat application that allow people to talk with others and send files, images, and other stuff in a very secure and organized way.

## User Journey

- When the user first opens the website, he will be asked to signup.
- If the user has an account, he can login to his profile by hitting `Login` button and use the application normally.
- Once the user logged in or signed up, he will be directed to the home page.
- In the home page, the user can find a list of the user he added on the left side, and a chat tap for each on of them on the right side.
- The user can find an `Add New Contacts` icon button, when he hits that icon, a pop-up will appear. The user can search for contacts by username and send `Add` request to them. After the other user approve the request, the two users can start a conversation using the app.
- In the chat part of the screen, the user can share images, files, and other stuff from the upload buttons.

## User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to create new account in the app.
- As a user, I should be able to login to my account if I already have one.
- As a user, I should be able to see the list of the contacts I previously added.
- As a user, I should be able to start or continue chatting with my contacts.
- As a user, I should be able to send files, images, videos, ... etc, to my contacts.
- As a user, I should be able to add new friends in the application.
- As a user, I should be able to approve or decline friends add requests.
- As a user, I should be able to logout from the application.
